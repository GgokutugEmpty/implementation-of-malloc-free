# Implementation Of Memory Allocator

This project implements a simple memory allocator using `malloc` and `free` functions. It demonstrates basic dynamic memory management using a fixed-size heap.

## Files

- `mallocfree.c`: Header file containing function prototypes and necessary includes.
- `main.c`: Source file with the implementation of `malloc`, `free`, and a test program.

## Compilation

To compile the project, use the following command:

```sh build.sh
